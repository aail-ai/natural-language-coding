# Original Prompts Log - Dice Simulator Development

## üìù Complete History of User Prompts

This document contains all the original prompts used during the development of the Dice Analytics Studio, in chronological order.

---

## **Prompt 1: Initial Request**
```
dice rolling simulator showing distribution/probability of rolls with animated dice and results dashboard
```

**Context:** First request to create the basic dice simulator application.

---

## **Prompt 2: Single Dice Modification**
```
single dice only
```

**Context:** Request to modify the simulator from multiple dice per roll to single dice per throw.

---

## **Prompt 3: Real-Time Visibility**
```
while it runs, let user see what is happening instead of using vblurred screen. also, show the results of 6 faces just like before
```

**Context:** User wanted to remove the loading overlay and ensure the 6-face results remained visible during the simulation.

---

## **Prompt 4: Layout Adjustments**
```
for the dice roll region, adjust the dice size for complete display on one page. 

for the dashboard, don't use the bars for % numbers, remove the bars from the 6 dice and put a pie chart above
```

**Context:** User requested two changes: 1) Adjust dice size to fit all on one page, 2) Replace bar charts with a pie chart visualization.

---

## **Prompt 5: Dynamic Sizing and Performance**
```
dice size should be auto-adjusted with number of dice, i.e. if only 1 die, make it a lot bigger. 

also double concurrent dice rolls when rolling larger numbers of dice
```

**Context:** Request for adaptive dice sizing based on quantity and improved performance for large numbers.

---

## **Prompt 6: Weighted Dice Feature**
```
add a "weighted dice" option that increases one face's chance by a range of 1% to 10%
```
  
  **Context:** User wanted to add a feature to bias dice rolls toward a specific face with adjustable probability.

  ## üìä **Prompt Analysis Summary**
  
  ### **Total Prompts:** 6
  ### **Development Phases:**
  1. **Foundation** (Prompts 1-2): Basic simulator creation and mechanics
  2. **User Experience** (Prompts 3-4): Real-time visibility and layout improvements  
  3. **Advanced Features** (Prompts 5-6): Dynamic scaling and weighted dice

### **Prompt Characteristics:**
- **Brevity:** Most prompts were concise (2-20 words)
- **Iterative:** Each built upon previous functionality
- **Specific Requests:** Clear feature additions or modifications
- **Problem-Solving:** Addressed UX issues as they arose

  ### **Development Evolution:**
  ```
  Basic Simulator ‚Üí Single Dice ‚Üí Real-Time ‚Üí Layout ‚Üí Scaling ‚Üí Weighting
  ```
  
  This progression shows a natural development flow from core functionality to advanced features.

  ## üéØ **Key Insights**
  
  1. **Short, focused prompts** can be effective when working iteratively
  2. **Building incrementally** allows for course correction and refinement
  3. **User experience issues** emerged naturally during testing and were addressed
  4. **Advanced features** were added after core functionality was solid
  
  This log serves as a reference for understanding the natural evolution of the project and the effectiveness of iterative prompting in AI-assisted development.
